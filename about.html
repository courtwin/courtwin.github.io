                                    <p>People looking to achieve more out of their personal and professional lives are greatly benefited from getting a coach. They may come from different backgrounds, but they all have this common desire to do better. It could be a college student searching for a career that is right for him. Or it could be an employee who wants to give and get more from her work. It could be a homemaker wanting to explore her talents and abilities outside home. Or it could be an entrepreneur looking to start his business or grow his products or services into the right market. It could be someone looking to lose those few extra pounds, or it could be someone facing challenges in a relationship. It could even be an organization that wants to create the kind of employees they would fight to keep. If you are one of these people, getting a coach to support you will help you turn your vision into your reality, and help you find balance in life.</p>

                                <div id="faq2" class="collapse">
                                    <p>Not at all. A consultant is a specific domain expert who can analyze your current status and provide a plan on how to do it better or right. A therapist or counselor helps you overcome psychological disorders. A mentor is someone who can directly help you get to where you want to go because she has done it herself. A coach is a qualified professional supporting normal, healthy individuals to realize their full potential and achieve sustained success and happiness. Think of a sports coach. He is not necessarily athletic or even an athlete himself. But he knows how to guide and give direction to his players to constantly improve their game. A Life Coach guides and gives direction to you to achieve success in your life.</p>

                                <div id="faq3" class="collapse">
                                    <p>That is a common concern. Coaching is very dynamic in nature, and differs from individual to individual based on their needs from time to time. We usually spend a session or two to sort out priorities, and understand issues or concerns you want sorted. That too is part of coaching.</p>

                                <div id="faq4" class="collapse">
                                    <p>Where are you today? Where do you want to go? How fast do you want to get there? The amount of time you would need to work with your coach would depend on your answers to these three questions. Some people can achieve their goals in two to three months. Some may take a year. Coaching continues as long as the client benefits from the engagement. Generally, to experience the effectiveness of a life coaching program, we suggest clients make an initial two-month commitment. At the end of the two months, we evaluate progress and discuss the need and options for continued coaching.</p>
                                    <p>At Courtwin, our goal is to empower you to become more independent in dealing effectively with new challenges and situations, because only by becoming self-sufficient can you move forward in your goal to achieve your full potential.</p>

                                    <p>We do not have a hard and fast age criteria for accepting clients. However, coaching requires a certain amount of maturity of thought, so our recommendation is to take coaching if you are above 15 or 16 years old. On a case by case basis, we may take a client under 15 years of age, but we request at least one parent or guardian to accompany their child.</p>

                            <p>For one who is young, Shrutakirti brings great maturity and professionalism into her coaching practice. She is enthusiastic, encouraging yet at the same time not afraid to challenge her client to do better. Its been a creative experience to work with her as my coach.</p>

                            <p>Everybody wants to be successful in their lives. I am not an exception. But, it is Courtwin, who helped me understand that there is always more ahead of success. When I was first introduced to this organisation, "Life Coaching" was an entirely new concept for me. I was unable to understand why I would need it. Then, as I started sessions with Shrutakirti, I gradually started seeing the impact of coaching in my life.</p>
                            <p>Shrutakirti is an excellent coach, but more importantly, she is a gem of a person. I feel very comfortable talking to her. She understands my requirements aptly and accordingly provides her help and guidance. I feel blessed to be associated with her.</p>
                            <p>In today's demanding life, I think it is always good take a halt to discover your true potential. And to be allied with Courtwin is the best way to do it.</p>

                            <p>I've known and worked with Shrutakirti for a while. She is someone who is extremely balanced in her life. She knows how to manage work and personal life. Extremely focused towards her work, she has always been a hard worker and winner. She will never give up or let you give up no matter what. You feel immensely positive when she is around you. Go to her for anything in life and trust me you will find a solution for it. Her helpful nature makes her an amazing person to work with. She shows immense commitment towards work always.</p>
                            <p>A reliable coach and an awesome friend. She's truly a role model for time management. With all of these she is super fun to be with. I look up and always admire her for the kind of person she is.</p>

                            <p>Shrutakirti is a young and dynamic girl. She's relatively new to the field of Life Coaching, so getting coaching from her is as much a learning process for her as it is for me. I was initially not sure how someone so young and new would be able to coach me (being older), but I realized over time, talking to her, that age is not a factor in the coaching process. Besides, the maturity with which she has coached me and helped me get to my goal has been impressive. I wish I had explored life coaching with her earlier. I wish Shrutakirti all the best in her new endeavour, Courtwin.</p>

                            <p>The most important thing of a life coach is the trust factor between coach and coachee. When I met Shrutakirti, it didn't take much time to develop that trust and confidence in her. She's very friendly and open-minded in her approach, which makes one feel at home. More than a coach, I could see a friend in her who really wants to help you out. She's very mature and confident, and knows how to handle any issue despite of the complexity of the issue. I am very happy and satisfied to be a small part of Courtwin by attending the sessions.</p>
