                                <p>You may have heard the story of the donkey and the couple. The story goes thus:</p>
                                <p>A couple from an Indian village is walking down the road with their donkey in tow. As they are going by, a man walking in the opposite direction laughs at them, for they have a beast of burden capable of carrying a man and yet both are walking. So the man gets on the donkey and they continue down the road, with the wife walking besides them. A little later, another passer by sees them and he too scoffs at the couple, for the man is sitting comfortably atop the donkey while making his wife walk. So the man makes his wife get on the donkey and he walks besides them. A little later still, another person going the other way sees them and scoffs, wondering why the man needs to walk alongside the ass. So the man too gets on the animal, and they both ride towards their destination. At last, the gullible man is happy, for no one is laughing at them, when a man sees them and shouts at them to show mercy on the poor donkey that is carrying the load of two people. He claims the poor beast is so tired that the man should instead carry it. And so the couple dismount and the man carries the beast on his back. And so on it goes.</p>
                                <p>The point of this story is to suggest that people mock, they criticize all the time, and that it is up to us whether to be affected by that criticism or not. A good point made through a clever and funny story, but that is not what I want to talk about today.</p>
                                <p>Consider the people who passed by and commented on the couple and their donkey. These people all had one thing in common: they were critical of any action the couple took, and were verbal about it. Often, in our own lives, we are those people. We see the faults with others around us and are all too happy to point them out. We are critical of them, we highlight the flaws in their actions, and we ignore the good in them. Walking besides the donkey could be seen as being kind towards the animal. Having the wife sit on it could be considered chivalrous. But we feel the need to only bring out flaws.</p>
                                <p>Why do we do it? There are many reasons. That does not matter. What is important is to remember that we are often like those critics who scoffed at the man no matter what he did, and to teach ourselves to stop doing it. Because that attitude is not helpful to anyone, least of all ourselves, and if we do not change our behaviour now, it is not just the beast of burden, but we who become the real asses.</p>

                                <h1>Busy-ness<br><small>Jaideep Ranade <small>April 15, 2016</small></small><hr></h1>
                                <img src="" alt="" class="img-responsive center-block">
                                <p>An entrepreneur-at-heart, working in a job, is a ticking time-bomb. There comes a time in the life of such entrepreneurs when they say to themselves: 'enough is enough. I must quit my job and follow my dream.' And a few of them actually quit their jobs. And a few of those actually start following their dreams. And those who do, soon find out that following their dream was not as easy as they thought. As they are setting up shop, they learn of the many issues that they would never face in their jobs, and in the beginning, the going is slow, progress is invisible. And that is all ok, for the entrepreneur, because they know what they're doing.</p>
                                <p>And then there's the others around them; others not used to the entrepreneurial lifestyle; others not knowing what it means to be an entrepreneur; others who believe that since you're not in a job, you're free, and always available. And that is understandable - our society has evolved to accept busy-ness being associated only to a job. They have heard stories of businessmen, but only the successful ones, who they see and believe as having all the time in the world. In their minds, therefore, if you're an entrepreneur, you've all the time in the world.</p>
                                <p>What most people miss, however, is that an entrepreneur is not a businessman. An entrepreneur is someone who's starting out with his own venture, with the hope that it will someday become a big business. So if you're an entrepreneur, unlike in a job, you have to do everything.</p>
                                <p>If you're an employee working as a programmer, then you write code. Someone else comes up with what software needs to be written, and someone else comes up with why you are doing anything at all, and someone works on creating an image for your company, and someone else handles the finances (paying your salary, for instance), and another looks at the legal aspects, and yet another goes and sells the product you're working on, and someone else handles employees and their issues, and so on. If you make a list of all the things that need to be done to run a company, you'll be shocked to see its length. Understand that the entrepreneur has to do all the things on the list, and probably a few more. So if you think that someone who's started their own venture is free all the time, think again. They're free at no time. Not even when they are home. If they're at home, it's to calm their minds and plan ahead. They know it'll be years before they can think of having some free time.</p>
                                <p>Entrepreneurs need the people around them to understand how busy they are, to accept that, and respect that, not just expect them to be available whenever, wherever, for whatever others may have in mind. So if you are an entrepreneur, know that it is OK to be busy all the time, and if you are not an entrepreneur and know someone who is, give them the space they need to grow.</p>

                                <img src="/images/blog-battle-of-the-bed.jpg" alt="" class="img-responsive center-block">
                                <p>Most people love the idea of winning the battle of the bed - of waking up early, but somehow it just doesn't seem to happen. Yet, there is something very special about waking up by 5 am every single day. I've been experiencing this wonderful time for many years now, and my wish is for all of you to be able to incorporate this habit of waking up early in your lives as well. It's simply a case of mind over mattress.</p>
                                <p>Getting up early is a complete game changer especially where productivity is concerned. The Spartans taught us that 'he who sweats more in training, bleeds less in war'. You need to wake up early when the world is asleep, to train, practice, and prepare your mind, heart, character, and spirit, so that whenever you walk out into the world you have taken control of your mind. You have reconnected with your mission and values. You're ready to take action, and not simply react to the world around you.</p>
                                <p>Spend the time in training or practice or personal development, preparing yourself for an incredible day. Robin Sharma says 'your day is your life in miniature, as you live your day so you live your life.' Getting up early gives you an enormous psychological edge; it is a primary win. It gives you immense confidence, an extraordinary point of differentiation from a majority of people in the world. You feel brave and strong: more a leader than a victim.</p>
                                <p>But it takes willpower to get up early. For some it takes little of that expendable resource, for some it takes a lot more. Willpower is like a muscle. Muscles are rested and stronger earlier in the day than later. They tire out with activity. Willpower is exactly the same. It is strongest early in the morning; that is when you have the most mental focus and the most energy. You will do things that you wish to do in the day with greater ease in the morning than you would do them during the rest of the day. You will get your fitness and mindset to extraordinary heights.</p>
                                <p>Since willpower is expendable, if you use it to wake up, there may be little left for use during the day. Instead, make waking up early a habit; hardwire in a new mental pathway and make it your new norm. Jump out of bed and overtake the world before the world takes over you. Make it a ritual.</p>
                                <p>Help yourself become an extreme achiever!</p>

                                <p>A smile says a thousand words. Smiling enhances communication. It lowers that initial barrier, making communication more effective. We receive better reception from people around us when we greet them with a smile. A sincere smile says 'I care'. Smiling releases pleasure hormones called endorphins, which also help calm us down. So, for example, when I'm invited for talks, and if I find the crowd to be intimidating, I just remind myself to smile as I start with my greeting. Smiling relaxes me, and it also tells the audience that I'm approachable and easy to talk to. Q&A sessions become easier and more interactive because I start with that openness.</p>
                                <p>Certainly, some conversations are difficult. Times when we have to reprimand someone, or give critical feedback, or teach a hard lesson, smiling can help make the conversation easier. Besides, those are times when people need that smile. It lets them know we care about them, and it makes them more receptive to what we have to say.</p>
                                <p>Today, I acknowledge the remarkable benefit that comes from having a pleasant demeanor. My ongoing commitment is to greet each person I encounter with a smile. What's your commitment today?</p>

                                <p>Our lives are often filled with activities that keep us busy but accomplish little more than maintaining the status quo. We have 24 hours a day, no more. What gets done is a matter of priority. Dr Stephen Covey, author of 7 Habits of Highly Effective People, said it best: <em>time management is a misnomer.</em> The real challenge is to manage ourselves. We can only manage our activities; time marches on, no matter what we do or don't do.</p>
                                <p>What about you? Do you feel you are running out of time? According to the author, W. Somerset Maugham, <em>the passing moment is all we can be sure of; it is only common sense to extract the utmost from it.</em> Life is precious. But we can lose sight of that fact if we are constantly struggling to find some time.</p>
                                <p>Let go of some of the busy-ness and invest in your future. Take a moment to decide what you need to do next.</p>

                                <p>The natural human tendency is to find stability, to find comfort, and settle. This is what motivates us, drives us. And in being so driven, we achieve varying degrees of those desires. Then we get comfortable; comfortable with accomplishments, comfortable in the position we find ourselves in, comfortable in having, in doing, and in being what we have, do, and become. And then?</p>
                                <p>It is hard to get out of this comfort zone, and the longer we stay there, the harder it gets. It is not permanent, eventually most of us get uncomfortable being comfortable, and when the discomfort is high enough, we are driven to find change.</p>
                                <p>There is a better way of staying motivated to achieve our potential. And like most things in life, it is simple, but not easy. It is simple to explain, but hard to adopt and internalize:</p>
                                <p><em>Do Be Do Be Do...</em></p>
                                <p>No, not the name of a cartoon dog, this is simply a message to get into a habit of continuous improvement. The Japanese call it <em>Kaizen</em>. Keep dreaming, keep doing, and keep achieving.</p>
                                <p>It is a difficult path to walk, and often we fall back into the prison of the comfort zone, but the coaches at Courtwin are here to help. If you want to keep moving ahead, always on a path to maximizing your capabilities, Courtwin will be glad to assist.</p>
                                <p>I once heard someone say something that very simply, very nicely sums up this point, and I will leave you with that:</p>

                                <p>Globally, <a href="http://www.catalyst.org/knowledge/statistical-overview-women-workplace" target="_blank">less than 20% of women</a> in the workplace hold CxO positions. It is evident that few women reach the upper echelons of our male-dominated workplaces. After considerable study, we know what has caused this skewed dynamic, and we know what needs to change to bring balance to this system. The time to bring about this change is now. Women today are free of many of the shackles compelling them to accept subordinate positions to men, and are ideally suited to be equal partners in leadership in the 21<sup>st</sup> century.</p>
                                <p>This message is about leadership and inspiring change. Women can lead alongside men, but progress has been slow. Women are not alone in this endeavour. This is not a takeover, but a journey towards equality, so men too should support this cause. Everyone's involvement is essential to create an environment in which equality is accepted and to develop necessary skills to implement this mind-set change.</p>
                                <p>Here at Courtwin, we are truly inspired to empower women across the world to take on leadership roles on an equal footing with men, to lead change with greater conviction, confidence, and courage, and to setup a pattern of continuous improvement in and of our workplaces and communities.</p>
                                <p>Through our trainings and in one-on-one coaching sessions, you will be introduced to some intriguing ideas which we will then help you convert into relevant experiences to enhance your life and work. We look forward to sharing our vision with you.</p>
